 ### AlterUSE
 This recycling system will be a web-based application designed to encourage individuals and communities to participate in recycling efforts. The system will provide a platform where users can report their collections of recyclable items, such as plastic bottles, aluminum cans, and glass bottles/jars, locate nearby recycling bins, track their recycling history, and earn rewards based on their contributions. The platform will also provide data insights for recycling companies to optimize recycling operations, manage recycling bins, and review recycling statistics. This project will align with **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**. This goal seeks to ensure sustainable management of resources and reduce waste through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse."
